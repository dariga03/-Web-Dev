    <h1>Poem</h1>
    <p>We were kids.,<br> In an abandoned landfill,<br>They played alone ...<br>
sometimes in "hide-and-seek", then in "tag"...<br>

Blinding sunset,<br>
And a moment passed<br>
And the singing of cicadas,<br>
Languishing singing...<br>

The evening burned down,<br>
The windows lit up with light<br>
And that's what I wanted,<br>
Don't think about it..
